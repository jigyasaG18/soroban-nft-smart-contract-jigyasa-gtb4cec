# Soroban NFT Smart Contract System

This repository contains a modular implementation of a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) smart contract system designed for the Stellar network using the Soroban SDK. NFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of digital or physical items.

## Overview

The system consists of several Rust smart contracts, each handling specific functionalities related to NFTs. These contracts can be imported and composed to create custom NFT solutions with various features.

### Features

- **Modularity:** Contracts are designed to be modular, allowing developers to choose and compose functionalities according to their needs.
- **ERC721 Standard:** The system follows the ERC721 standard, enabling interoperability with other platforms and applications.
- **Transparency:** All contract actions and events are logged on the blockchain for transparency and auditability.
- **Security:** Built-in functions ensure secure ownership management, preventing unauthorized transfers and ensuring tamper-proof records.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and deploy the Soroban NFT Smart Contract System:

1. **Setup Soroban CLI:** Install the Soroban CLI by following the instructions [here](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/setup).

2. **Clone Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/soroban-nft.git
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the cloned repository and install dependencies using Cargo:
   ```bash
   cd soroban-nft
   cargo install --locked
   ```

4. **Build Contracts:** Build the smart contracts using Soroban CLI:
   ```bash
   soroban contract build
   ```

5. **Deploy Contracts:** Deploy the compiled contracts to the Stellar network using Soroban CLI. Refer to the contract-specific deployment instructions provided in each contract's documentation.

6. **Interact with Contracts:** Once deployed, you can interact with the contracts using the provided interface functions. Use Soroban CLI or integrate with your application using the Stellar SDK.

## Usage

- Refer to the contract-specific documentation and interface for detailed usage instructions and available functions.
- Ensure you have sufficient test XLM tokens in your Stellar Testnet account for contract deployment and testing purposes.
- Follow best practices for smart contract development and security to avoid potential vulnerabilities and risks.
