This project implements a decentralized Non-Fungible Token (NFT) system on the Stellar network using the Soroban SDK. NFTs are managed through smart contracts, ensuring uniqueness, transparency, and secure ownership transfers.

## Key Features

- **NFT Creation:** Users can mint new NFTs with unique identifiers and associated metadata.
- **Ownership Management:** Smart contracts handle ownership transfers and approvals, ensuring secure and transparent transactions.
- **Event Logging:** The system logs events such as transfers, minting, burning, and approvals for auditing purposes.
- **Metadata Management:** Metadata such as name, symbol, and URI associated with each NFT are stored securely on the blockchain.

## Prerequisites

- A Stellar Testnet account with some test XLM tokens.
- Basic understanding of Rust programming and the Stellar network.
- Soroban SDK installed ([https://soroban.stellar.org/install.sh](https://soroban.stellar.org/install.sh))

## Project Setup

1. **Clone this repository.**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cargo install --locked
   soroban build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```

## Usage

- After successfully compiling the contract, you will find a newly created folder named **â€˜targetâ€™** containing the wasm executable.
- Deploy the compiled smart contract to the Stellar network using Soroban.
- Interact with the deployed contract using Stellar accounts to mint, transfer, and manage NFTs.
- Monitor contract events for auditing and transparency purposes.
